# Compile_Satellite_for_CNN

By Jiacheng Ling 
This project provides an example for modeling species distribution with convolutional neural network.

This project is initially for:
1. Modeling species distribution of Calidris Alpina in Nouvelle Aquitaine, France with a simple MaxEnt model example
2. Modeling C. Alpina's distribution with a simple RGB satellite image with convolutional neural network (CNN).

You can build your own CNN model with this project, all you need is:

1. A satellite map of your research area as .tiff file.
2. A boundary of your research area as .shp file.
3. Presence data downloaded from GBIF, as .csv file.

All data are expected to be stored under the same folder. In your input folder, you need to have:
1. a .tiff/.tif file
2. a .shp file
3. a .csv file

How to run them?
