# Compile_Satellite_for_CNN

By Jiacheng Ling 
This project provides an example for modeling species distribution with convolutional neural network.

This project is initially for:
1. Modeling species distribution of Calidris Alpina in Nouvelle Aquitaine, France with a simple MaxEnt model example
2. Modeling C. Alpina's distribution with a simple RGB satellite image with convolutional neural network (CNN).

You can build your own CNN model with this project, all you need is:

1. A satellite map of your research area as .tiff file.
2. A boundary of your research area as .shp file.
3. Presence data downloaded from GBIF.

Please store all three files in the folder: Works/Package_x.
